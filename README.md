<h2 style="text-align:center">Abstract</h2>
Our Java/Angular full stack project is envisioned to have an impact on e-shopping , it consists on developing a web platform that allows shoppers to get recommendations for tech gadgets based on the user's description. It contains principally two types of services :
<br>
<br>

&emsp;&emsp;-General Recommendation for guest.

&emsp;&emsp;-Personalized Recommendations for subscribers.


During a visit, users will have the option to choose Guest mode that offers a recommendation based on a description paragraph given by the user, or choose Authentication mode that can either be done through signing up to the platform or with a Google account 

The Tech-gadgets platform facilitate therefore the process of shopping by recommending electronic devices to users according to their needs.
